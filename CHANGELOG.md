## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-15
### 🛠️ Changed
- Styles are now served as a separate CSS file (`dist/tv-menu.css`) generated by Vite during the build process.
- Users must now explicitly import the stylesheet in their application:
  - For Vue/Vite SPA: `import '@todovue/tv-menu/style.css'` in `main.ts`
  - For Nuxt 3/4: Add `'@todovue/tv-menu/style.css'` to the `css` array in `nuxt.config.ts`

### ✨ Added
- Added `sideEffects` field to `package.json` to support proper tree-shaking with CSS files.
- Added `./style.css` export path in `package.json` for explicit CSS imports.
- Improved SSR/SSG compatibility, especially for Nuxt 3/4 applications.

### 📦 Dependencies
